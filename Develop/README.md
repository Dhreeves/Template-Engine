# Team Generator: Template Engine

## Project Description
Build a software engineering team generator command line application that generates a webpage that displays the team's basic information with quick access to emails and GitHub profiles. 

## User Story
The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, with a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a team roster based on the information provided by the user.
